# icinga2-ansible
Add Icinga2 clients using Ansible

I've noticed that many of the roles on Ansible Galaxy were either out of date or did not support Ubuntu. This role is mostly based off of the great playbook put together by mamercad @ https://github.com/mamercad/ansible-icinga2-client albeit much more simplified here.
